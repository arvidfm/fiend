The Corben's arrived today so I met up with them at the station. They seem like 
a nice family with two adorable children. I hope that they will enjoy 
their stay in the Heir mansion.

There is a heavy local thunderstorm going on when I am writing this. 
Maybe some trees will block the road. Luckily I have just filled up the
food supplies, so I have nothing to worry about.

I met Joseph Corben today. I waved and said hi but he didn't even look at me. 
According to Emilie he had have a hard time sleeping the last few days, and
claimed that was the reason why he is so grumpy.
; LINE
She said it was nothing to worry about and that he would probably get better 
soon.

Emilie came to me today and wanted me to check on Joseph. Apparently he had gotten
a terrible headache and was forced to lie in bed.
; LINE
When I came to the mansion Joseph seemed very ill. He was sweating in large amounts and had
troubles talking. The strange thing was that his temperature seemed to be normal, so
I said to Emilie that he should drink plenty of water, keep in bed and after a day or two 
he should start to feel better.

I hope he gets better soon.

I haven't heard from the Corben's since I last saw them, wonder if anything has happened.
I should probably go and see them tomorrow.

I have heard a very high amount howling from the wolves in the woods. Normally you never hear 
them at all.

I went to see the Corben's today but nobody answered my knocks on the front door.
I tried to open it, but it was locked. The cellar door was barricaded by heavy wooden
planks so I couldn't enter that way without using some kind of tool.

On my way home I saw Joseph dragging something wrapped up in a large piece of cloth
through the forest. I called for him, but he didn't seem to hear me.

I should probably contact Emilie's brother, Harold.

The wolves are starting to circulate outside the village and the villagers, including
me, are afraid to go outside after dusk. Last night I heard something scratching on the front door
and sounds not belonging to any animal known by me.

I have made some research on the Hier mansion and found out that the original owner, Emilie's father,
did some things that disturbed the locals. The events with wolves howling and mysterious sounds
seem to have happened then as well. 
;
Another disturbing thing is the foul stenches I have sensed when walking near the mansion. The odors remind
me of things I have read in some of the dreaded tomes in the Miskatonic University library. These facts forces me 
to make a conclusion to horrible to write down.

Harold arrived today and after some discussion he came up with the same terrifying inference as me.
We both knew what had to be done and the same evening we made the ancient rituals as good as we could and carved in
protective inscriptions on the walls of a mine in my possession.

Hope the madness comes to an end now.

It is evening now and I haven't heard any howling or other abnormal sounds. It seems like our
rituals were successful.
; LINE
; LINE
To avoid anyone else from entering the mansion I have sealed the gate with a robust padlock. Since only
I, Harold and the locals knew that the Corben's have been staying in the mansion we made up a believable
story to the police about the their disappearance.

Now I can only pray that history does not repeat itself.
