Vague misgivings of the last quarter hour are now becoming definite fears. To begin with, I am 
thoroughly convinced that something must have happened to Dobbs. For the first time since we have
been together he has failed to answer my summons. When he did not respond to my repeated ringing
I decided that the bell must be out of order, but I have pounded on the table with vigor enough
to rouse a charge of Charon. At first I thought he might have slipped out of the house for a
breath of fresh air, for it has been hot and sultry all the forenoon, but it is not like Dobbs
 to stay away so long without first making sure that I would want nothing. It is, however, 
the unusual occurrence of the last few minutes which confirms my suspicion that Dobbs's absence
 is a matter beyond his control. It is this same happening which prompts me to put my impressions 
and conjectures on paper in the hope that the mere act of recording them may relieve a certain 
sinister suggestion of impending tragedy. Try as I will, I cannot free 
my mind from the legends connected with this old house - mere superstitious fol-de-rol for dwarfed 
brains to revel in, and on which I would not even waste a thought if Dobbs were here.

Through the years that I have been shut away from the world I used to know, Dobbs has been my sixth 
sense. Now, for the first time since my incapacitation, I realize the full extent of my impotency. 
It is Dobbs who had compensated for my sightless eyes, my useless ears, my voiceless throat, and my 
crippled legs. There is a glass of water on my 
typewriter table. Without Dobbs to fill it when it has been emptied, my plight will be like that of 
Tantalus. Few have come to this house since we have lived here - there is little in common between 
garrulous country folk and a paralytic who cannot see, hear, or speak to them - it may be days before
 anyone else appears. Alone... with only my thoughts to keep me company; disquieting thoughts which 
have been in no wise assuaged by the sensations of the last few minutes. I do not like these sensations,
either, for more and more they are converting mere village gossip into a fantastic imagery which affects
my emotions in a most peculiar and almost unprecedented manner.

It seems hours since I started to write this, but I know it can be only a few minutes, for I have just 
inserted this fresh page into the machine. The mechanical action of switching the sheets, brief though
it was, has given me a fresh grip on myself.

Perhaps I can shake off this sense of approaching danger long enough to recount that which has already
happened.
