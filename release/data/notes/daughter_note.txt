Father got mad at us. Mother said he wanted to hurt us. Mother
told me to hide. I locked the door from the inside and hid under the bed.
Father was outside and angry. He hit the door many times and screamed, but
he is gone now.

I am scared, I hear the rats in the walls. I scream when they come
and then they go away. They are getting more and more. One bit me in the leg.
I am bleeding. I am so scared. Mother where are you?
