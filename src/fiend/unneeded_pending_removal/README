These are files that were in /src/fiend when uploaded. I don't think any of these files are needed, but
it would be best to look into it first to make sure no files that are needed get deleted. Also,
Fiend.vcproj might be good to keep.
Also, I'm kind of hesitant to remove these files considering that they are almost ten years old,
kind of feels like history. Of course, the original source archive uploaded by Thomas Grip is
still there, but still.
