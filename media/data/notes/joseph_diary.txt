We arrived at the Hier mansion today and it was everything we could ever hope 
for. We also met Dr Davies, who seems to be a nice man.

I'm sure we will have a great time here.

Last night I had the worst nightmare I have ever had. Never have a dream felt
so real, I woke up shaking and sweating like a pig. Hope I never experience something like that
again.

I had the same nightmare this night, but this time it was even worse. Those eyes hunted me through
dark corridors and it all felt so real. I even woke up with pain in my feet.
; LINE
I am afraid to sleep now, afraid I will dream the dream again, afraid of those eyes, those horrible
eyes.

I tried not to fall asleep but it didn't work, and it came after me again. It chased me through those
endless tunnels. It called for me and it felt more real then ever. The dreams are making me
lose my temper and I shouted at Emilie today. I have never done that before. What is happening 
to me?

I can't stand it anymore, it gets worse every day. I must be scratching myself in my sleep. The two
latest nights I have woken up marks all over my body. I don't know how much longer I can handle 
this anymore.

Emilie seem very upset and worried about me but I can't talk to her anymore without feeling an anger
at her. I have stopped talking to her and I am having an hard time answering her questions. Mostly
I just scream at her in reply.

The eyes are inside me, their soul flowed through my body yesterday. It talks to me all the
time now, not only in my dreams. It wants me, it needs me.

The way I am looking at my child's and wife now. They are not my family anymore. The thoughts
I am thinking about them, those unholy thoughts. I did not thought that was possible.

I am also starting to follow its directions now. I am becoming one with it.

It is showing me the path now. The way to eternity. The way to the stars. I am reading the tomes.
I know languages since long forgotten. It helps me. It is making me more than I have ever been.

My master, my master.

I gave my master his gift today. I placed his seed in my wife. My daughter got away. 
The small helpers will take her. There is no escape.

The screams of my boy filled me with joy. His flesh gives power to my master, his pain
fills him with energy. I made him lose his life slowly and my wife watched it. I used no 
tools, just my teeth and nails. Just as my master wanted.

My wife got the same treatment when my boy couldn't take anymore. I enjoyed every second. 
My master has showed me the way. Guided my hands and mouth.

in the ground above together. The stars will be right soon. The glorious moment
will come soon.

They disturbed the balance, but master says it does not matter.

The power will be even greater soon. Then he will rise, rise from his 
prison.
