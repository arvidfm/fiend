To keep my sanity I must write down what I have dreamed the last nights.

I hope my wife never finds this paper and nobody else for that matter.
This is just an attempt from me to understand the ominous visions that
have haunted my dreams.

The eyes speaks to me, they know who I am and what I feel. It shows me
a dark dungeon inhabited by strange beings. And at the bottom of an endless
pit, the soul of the eyes lies and waits.

He calls to me. He showed my wife and my unborn child hanging from the ceiling.

I dream this every night and it feels stronger all the time. I must go to the 
mansion and find the eyes, find their blasphemous soul, find peace in my dreams
before I go insane. I must do it soon or else it will be too late.
