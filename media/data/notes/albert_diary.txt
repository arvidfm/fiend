My studies in the Necronomicon has taught me some ancient
rites that I have preformed the last nights. I have tried 
to reach the old one inprisoned under the sea.

Ever since I started, he has sent us dreams in reply, Everybody
in the house has got the message but I seem to have the clearest visions.

I never thought that I could come this far. I must find out how to do 
even more. This feels just like the beginning.

The dreams still continue, but I am not dreaming about the lost city of R'leyh.
I am dreaming of some catacombs that seem to be very close.

The wolves have begun to howl. I must have done something wrong this is not what
I have read about.

The dreams of the underground have just become stronger and stronger. Something seems
to call for me, something that dwells in those dungeons. I have felt a strong feeling to 
investigate the cellar of this house. I will talk to the locals tomorrow and try to get 
some workers.

It took the whole day but we finally found the catacombs. They truly exist. 
; LINE

I will investigate them tomorrow.

The howling of the wolves have gotten stronger. The locals are afraid to go out at night and 
so are my servants.

My heart is still pounding after today's events.

As company down the dark tunnels I had 3 locals.
; LINE

The walls of the catacombs where filled with signs that I had never seen before
and seemed much older than mankind. When we had gone a little bit into 
the catacombs we began hearing some strange sounds. Sounds that didn't resemble
anything that I have heard before and it got louder as we got further into the tunnels.
; LINE
; LINE
One of the locals suddenly got panic and ran away from us. We screamed at him and told him to stop but he didn't
listen. The catacombs are a real maze and if we had followed him we would probably just got lost. So
we stayed put and called for him.
; LINE
; LINE
After a little while we heard it. The scream was the most terrified scream I have ever heard.
What ever happened to the local must have been something that wasn't supposed to happen to any man.
I can still hear the scream in my head, I think I will always remember it.
; LINE
; LINE
When the scream was gone we heard another sound. A blasphemous sound not of this world. And it was approaching.
We started to run home as fast as we could and the terrible sound just felt closer and closer. Luckely 
we had marked the way we got here so we had no trouble finding home. As soon as we got out of the 
catacombs we sealed the hatch leading down to the underground.

I must have dropped the sun amulet in the catacombs. I can't continue my rituals now, since there is no way that I
am going down after it.

It tried to take control of me. Something even more dangerous than the thing
that took the life of the local. I must have summoned it instead of talking to the great
Cthulhu.
; LINE 
; LINE
I think I can dispel it by mixing the powder of Xtanopel and burning it in a triangle
of the amulets, but since I lost the sun amulet there is no use in trying.

I am leaving the mansion today and I am never returning. The creature only has power in this house,
so as long nobody ever enters here the world is safe from it.
