Dear Harold.

Some strange things has happened in this house lately and I don't know who else 
to turn to. Joseph has become stranger and stranger ever since we got here. First
he complained about nightmares and I thought it was because of that, but now I don't
know.

Four days ago he got a terrible headache and ever since that
he has been in the library all the time. He hasn't even gone to bed at night.

I have tried to talk to him but he hasn't even looked in my direction, he just mumbles words
in a way I have never heard him talk in before. I am really worried about him and would be grateful
if you could come over here and try to talk with him.

I will try to post this letter tonight.
